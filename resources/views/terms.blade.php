        <b>Responsibility:</b>
        <br>
        <br> 
        <b>Customer</b> - Lucky Fuds Catering will assist with any additional items during the event. However, we are not financially responsible for any items provided by customers for the event. We will only be responsible for those items and services listed on the catering agreement that we provide. It is understood that the customer will conduct the event in full compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, regulations, and facility contracts.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Equipment</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Lucky Fuds Catering rents equipment for customer event needs. Rented equipment must be utilized as intended and returned in its original state to the caterer. If the product is damaged, the catering agreement's rental fee will cover the costs. Additional costs may be incurred for recovering lost or stolen equipment. The caterer will inform the customer of all costs. The caterer will invoice the customer for any additional costs incurred, which should be paid upon receipt.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Cancellation</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        A cancellation of a contract will only be accepted in writing via call or email. If a cancellation is received five (5) days before the event, the 25% deposit will be refunded, including all payments. If cancellation is received less than the allowed timeframe, the client will be responsible for any costs incurred by the caterer by reason of the breach thereof, and the 25% deposit payment will be retained, including all payments to determine overall liquidated costs. Unless prior arrangements between the caterer and the customer have been made, the final invoice will provide details, including the total refund amount.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Services</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Services provided are managed independently. However, to ease the burden of working with each individual company, Lucky Fuds Catering will obtain all information, and the service will contact the customer to discuss specific details for the event.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Event Timeline and Staffing</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Each event is unique and will require a different timeline. Details will be discussed prior to the schedule to ensure staff and customer needs are met. Event staffing is based on the guest count and date of the event. Lucky Fuds Catering staff will discuss the service plan for the event prior to scheduling. Pricing may vary based on event needs. If your event exceeds the allotted duration, additional hours will be invoiced to the customer at the rate outlined in the catering agreement per service.
